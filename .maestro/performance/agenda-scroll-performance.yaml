# Agenda/Calendar Scroll Performance Test
# Requirements: 30s continuous scroll over 1,000 tasks
# SLA: avg FPS ≥58, P95 frame ≤16.7ms, dropped frames ≤1%, 0 blank cells
#
# IMPORTANT: This test MUST run on RELEASE builds only
# CI will fail if __DEV__ is true during performance validation
#
# Prerequisites:
# - Database seeded with 1000+ tasks across multiple dates
# - Mix of pending, completed, and skipped tasks
# - Tasks with and without reminders
#
# Run with:
# maestro test .maestro/performance/agenda-scroll-performance.yaml --format junit --output agenda-performance.xml
#
# For Android Perfetto trace collection:
# 1. Start trace: adb shell perfetto -c - --txt -o /data/misc/perfetto-traces/trace
# 2. Run this test
# 3. Stop trace and pull: adb pull /data/misc/perfetto-traces/trace perfetto-trace.pb
# 4. Open in https://ui.perfetto.dev

# Verify we're on a release build (no dev menu)

# Navigate to agenda tab

# === 30-SECOND CONTINUOUS SCROLL TEST ===
# Scroll pattern: slow continuous scroll to stress-test rendering pipeline
# This tests heterogeneous list performance (date headers + task rows)

# Scroll 1: Top to bottom (0-10s)
- scroll:
    direction: DOWN
    duration: 10000
    speed: 40

# Scroll 2: Continue down (10-20s)
- scroll:
    direction: DOWN
    duration: 10000
    speed: 40

# Scroll 3: Continue down (20-30s)
- scroll:
    direction: DOWN
    duration: 10000
    speed: 40

# Quick verification: no blank cells visible
- assertVisible:
    id: 'agenda-item-.*'
- assertNotVisible: 'Blank Cell'
- assertNotVisible: 'Error Loading'

# Scroll back up to test bidirectional performance (30-40s)
- scroll:
    direction: UP
    duration: 10000
    speed: 40

# Rapid scroll test: stress test FlashList recycling (40-50s)
- repeat:
    times: 5
    commands:
      - scroll:
          direction: DOWN
          duration: 1000
          speed: 80
      - scroll:
          direction: UP
          duration: 1000
          speed: 80

# Final verification: agenda still responsive
- assertVisible:
    id: 'agenda-screen'

# Test interaction after heavy scrolling
- tapOn:

# Memory check: app should still be responsive

# === SUCCESS CRITERIA (verified in CI) ===
# These metrics are captured via external tooling:
#
# 1. FPS Metrics (via RN Performance or Perfetto):
#    - Average FPS ≥58 during 30s scroll
#    - P95 frame time ≤16.7ms
#    - Dropped frames ≤1%
#    - Jank count ≤5 per 1k frames
#
# 2. Memory Metrics (via Android Profiler or Instruments):
#    - RSS increase ≤50 MB during scroll
#    - Post-GC memory within ≤10 MB of baseline
#
# 3. Visual Quality:
#    - 0 blank cells observed
#    - All task rows render immediately
#    - No "Error Loading" states
#
# 4. Responsiveness:
#    - App remains interactive after test
#    - No ANR/freeze events
#    - Tap interactions work immediately
